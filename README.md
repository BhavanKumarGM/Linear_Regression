# 📈 Simple Linear Regression – Height vs Weight

This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression model** using Python to predict a person’s **height** based on their **weight**.

It demonstrates the **end-to-end machine learning workflow**:
data loading → preprocessing → model training → evaluation → prediction → visualization.

This is a **foundational ML project**, built correctly (no silent bugs, no data leakage).
